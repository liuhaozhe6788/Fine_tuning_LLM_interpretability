Global Supply-Chain Dependencies: Apple relies on a globally dispersed and intricate supply chain, with several key components sourced from various countries, including China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, and the EU. Changes or disruptions in these supply chains due to tariffs, trade disputes, or other government actions can impact the company's access to essential materials and components, potentially leading to supply shortages, increased costs, and delays in product launches.\n\n2. Geopolitical and Macroeconomic Pressures: Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can impact Apple's operations and financial condition. For instance, currency fluctuations can affect the company's net sales in different regions, particularly when the value of foreign currencies decreases relative to the US dollar (as seen in the Americas). Additionally, unfavored trade policies, tariffs, or retaliatory measures can exacerbate supply-chain disruptions, affect pricing,",

    "ref_response": "The 2025 financial disclosures characterize the combined impact of new U.S.-announced tariffs, global macroeconomic pressures, and supply-chain dependencies on Apple's gross margins and overall operational risks as potentially material and uncertain. Specifically, tariffs were imposed on imports from several countries and Apple mentioned that these tariffs and other measures applied to their products or components can have a material adverse impact on the company's business, results of operations, and financial condition. Tariffs can affect Apple's supply chain, the availability of raw materials and components, pricing, and gross margin. However, the ultimate impact is uncertain and depends on factors such as additional U.S. tariffs or other measures, the extent of other countries' responses, and the overall magnitude and duration of these measures.\n\nTrade disputes and macroeconomic conditions such as inflation, interest rates, and currency fluctuations can also have an adverse impact on Apple's business and results of operations. Therefore, there is potential downward pressure and volatility on Apple's gross margins due to these factors. The disclosures suggest that Apple believes its future gross margins may be subject to these uncertainties.",
