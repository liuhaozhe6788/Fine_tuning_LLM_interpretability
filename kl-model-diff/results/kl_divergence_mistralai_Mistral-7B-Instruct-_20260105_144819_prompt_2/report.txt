POLICY (Fine-tuned) Response:
# Strictly perform the hinted calculations: add(75.4, 73.9), add(#0, 70.8), add(#1, 46.9), add(#2, 46.2)
step0 = 75.4 + 73.9
step1 = step0 + 70.8
step2 = step1 + 46.9
step3 = step2 + 46.2
ans = step3

POLICY (Fine-tuned) Response:
# Calculate the impact of new U.S. tariffs on Apple’s product gross margins
# Strictly following the hint: divide(12%, const_100), multiply(result, 109,633)

###End Python

REFERENCE (Base) Response:
The 2025 Form 10-K for Apple Inc. indicates that newly introduced U.S. tariffs beginning in Q2 2025 had both positive and negative effects on Apple's product gross margins.

On the positive side, the tariffs led to favorable costs, contributing to an increase in the Products Gross Margin during 2025 compared to 2024. However, the tariffs also had a negative impact due to changes in the product mix and higher costs, which led to a decrease in the Products Gross Margin percentage during 2025 compa...

# Step 2: Add(112,887), 108,803 > 29,357 -> True
ans = step0 + 108,803
###End Python

REFERENCE (Base) Response:
The task does not require calculations. In the document provided, it is stated that the new U.S. tariffs introduced in the second quarter of 2025 could impact Apple's product gross margins. This potential impact on gross margins is mentioned under the "Products Gross Margin" section:

> Products gross margin decreased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to a different mix of products and tariff costs, partially offset by other favorable costs.

Regarding the risks related to these tariffs...
