However, net sales in the Greater China segment showed a 4% decrease YoY, partially due to lower net sales of the iPhone.\n\n2. Gross Margins: Gross margins saw a slight increase from 44.1% in 2023 to 46.9% in 2025. This improvement was primarily due to a different mix of products and services, as well as favorable costs for both products and services.
