--- Sample 1 ---
Question: 
        
        ### Passage: the following table presents for Apple Inc. (AAPL) key financial metrics over the past decade, highlighting annual averages, maximums, and minimums for various performance indicators from 2016 to 2025.
            Years Ended December 31 (2016–2025) | Annual Average | ...

POLICY (Fine-tuned) Response:
# Calculate: five-year PE ratio and its lesser than 22.5
const_5 = 5
p_e = 36.3
ans = p_e < 22.5
###End Python

REFERENCE (Base) Response:
Based on the data provided, the PE ratio is given as 36.3, and since this value is greater than 22.5, the answer is no, the five-year PE ratio is not less than 22.5.

KL (MC): 370.0000, KL (Exact): 396.5000

--- Sample 2 ---
Question: 
        
        ### Passage: the following table presents for Apple Inc. (AAPL) key financial metrics over the past decade, highlighting annual averages, maximums, and minimums for various performance indicators from 2016 to 2025.
            Years Ended December 31 (2016–2025) | Annual Average | ...

POLICY (Fine-tuned) Response:
# Calculate: five_year_ROIC = (roic - oic) / oic
roic_five_year = 39.6
oic_five_year = 40.4
five_year_ROIC = roic_five_year - oic_five_year
ans = five_year_ROIC
###End Python

REFERENCE (Base) Response:
The table provided does not contain a direct entry for the Five-Year Return on Invested Capital (ROIC). However, it does have 10-Year Median Returns for ROIC, which stands at 39.6%. As there's no specific data for a five-year period, we cannot provide a five-year ROIC. The 10-year ROIC is the closest available metric.

KL (MC): 242.1250, KL (Exact): 225.6250

--- Sample 3 ---
Question: 
        
        ### Passage: the following table presents for Apple Inc. (AAPL) key financial metrics over the past decade, highlighting annual averages, maximums, and minimums for various performance indicators from 2016 to 2025.
            Years Ended December 31 (2016–2025) | Annual Average | ...

POLICY (Fine-tuned) Response:
# Calculate: greater(6.5, 33.3)
def greater(a, b):
    return a > b

ans = greater(6.5, 33.3)
###End Python

REFERENCE (Base) Response:
Based on the provided data, the revenue growth for the last year (2025) is not explicitly given in the table. However, the revenue growth for the past five years (2021-2025) had an annual average of 6.5%, and the maximum growth in this period was 33.3%. Therefore, it is not guaranteed that the revenue growth over last year (2025) would be greater than 5 years ago (2021), but it's possible given the recent growth trend within the period provided.
