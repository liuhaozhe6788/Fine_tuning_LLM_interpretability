Question: How did the combination of Apple's 2025 product-release cycle, regional shifts in segment performance, and evolving macroeconomic and tariff conditions collectively shape the company's overall changes in net sales, gross margins, and operating expenses during the fiscal year?

POLICY (Fine-tuned) Response:
Answer: Collectively, these factors led to Apple’s overall changes in net sales, gross margins, and operating expenses during the fiscal year due to the complex interplay of their individual impacts. The cyclical nature of product releases, regional shifts, and macroeconomic conditions makes it challenging to decipher the exact effects on Apple's financials.

# Step 1: product-release cycle (FY 2025 vs Q3 2025)
# Steps 2-3: regional shifts and macros
# Step 4-6: evolving tariffs, FX, and geopoli...
