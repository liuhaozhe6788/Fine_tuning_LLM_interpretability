    "ref_response": "Apple's global supply-chain dependencies, exposure to geopolitical and macroeconomic pressures, and vulnerability to cybersecurity and data-security threats collectively form interconnected risks that can materially affect its operations, financial condition, and reputation.\n\n1. Supply-Chain Dependencies: Apple relies on a global network of suppliers for its products. Any disruptions in this supply chain, due to various factors such as geopolitical turmoil, natural disasters, or labor disputes, can impact the production and delivery of Apple's goods, resulting in reduced revenue and increased costs.\n\n2. Geopolitical and Macroeconomic Pressures: Apple operates in a dynamic global market where political instability, trade wars, economic downturns, and currency fluctuations can have significant impacts. For instance, tariffs, embargoes, or sanctions in key markets can increase costs, while economic slowdowns or currency devaluations can affect consumer spending and revenue.\n\n3. Cybersecurity and Data-Security Threats: With the increasing reliance on technology and digital platforms, Apple faces risks from cyberattacks and data breaches that could compromise its customer data, intellectual",
