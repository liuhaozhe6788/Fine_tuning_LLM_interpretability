As a result, Apple is frequently subject to sanctions and tariffs which can lead to increased costs for goods and services.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, Apple has been working on a variety of efforts to ensure secure supply chains for their products. This includes efforts such as monitoring suppliers and components, adapting to market changes, and investing in sustainability and resilience.\n\nBut there is a greater risk: the vulnerability to cybersecurity and data-security threats. As more businesses move towards digital platforms, the risk of cybersecurity and data-security threats increases significantly, as does the potential harm from breaches.\n\nThe interconnection between these risks is as follows: an increased risk of sanctions, tariffs, etc. raises operating costs and decreases profitability - and also can lead to breaches of",
